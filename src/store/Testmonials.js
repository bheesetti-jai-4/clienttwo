            "description": "A stress test evaluates how the heart functions under physical exertion. Patients walk on a treadmill or receive medication to increase heart rate while doctors monitor heart rhythm, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. This test helps detect coronary artery disease, irregular heartbeats, and other cardiac conditions. It is often recommended for people experiencing chest pain or those at risk of heart disease. Results guide further treatment and lifestyle changes."

            "description": "Cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure used to diagnose and treat heart conditions. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted into a blood vessel and guided to the heart to check for blockages, measure pressure, or perform treatments like angioplasty. This procedure helps diagnose coronary artery disease, heart valve disorders, and heart defects. It is performed under local anesthesia and provides detailed heart function information without major surgery."

            "description": "An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive test that records the heart's electrical activity. It helps detect irregular heartbeats, heart attacks, and other cardiac conditions. Small sensors called electrodes are placed on the skin to measure electrical impulses. ECG is commonly used for diagnosing arrhythmias, heart attacks, and monitoring heart health over time. It is a simple and quick procedure with no discomfort for patients."

            "description": "Echocardiography, also known as an echo, is an ultrasound imaging test that assesses heart function and structure. It uses sound waves to create real-time images of the heart, helping diagnose conditions like valve disorders, heart failure, and congenital defects. This test is safe, painless, and provides valuable insights into how well the heart is pumping blood. Doppler echocardiography also evaluates blood flow through the heart and major arteries."

            "title": "Coronary Angioplasty",
            "image": "/service/one.jpeg",
            "description": "Coronary angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries and improve blood flow to the heart. A small balloon is inserted and inflated at the blockage site, often followed by placing a stent to keep the artery open. It helps relieve chest pain (angina) and reduces the risk of heart attacks. This minimally invasive procedure is essential for treating coronary artery disease and restoring normal heart function."

            "title": "Heart Bypass Surgery",
            "image": "/service/four.jpeg",
            "description": "Heart bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), is a major surgery that improves blood flow to the heart by bypassing blocked arteries. Surgeons take a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body and attach it to the heart, creating a new route for oxygen-rich blood. This surgery is recommended for severe coronary artery disease and helps prevent heart attacks, improve heart function, and extend life expectancy."

            "image": "/service/three.jpeg",
            "description": "Pacemaker implantation is a procedure where a small electronic device is placed under the skin to regulate abnormal heart rhythms. The pacemaker sends electrical signals to the heart to ensure a steady heartbeat. It is used for conditions like bradycardia (slow heart rate) or heart block. This device helps prevent fatigue, dizziness, and heart failure. Modern pacemakers can adjust heart rates based on physical activity and improve overall heart health."

            "image": "service/two.jpeg",
            "description": "Heart valve repair or replacement is a surgical procedure to fix or replace damaged heart valves. Valves regulate blood flow in the heart, and when they fail, it can lead to severe health issues. Repair involves reshaping the valve, while replacement uses a mechanical or biological valve. This procedure improves circulation, relieves symptoms like breathlessness, and enhances heart efficiency. It is crucial for patients with valve diseases like stenosis or regurgitation."

            "description": "Cardiac rehabilitation is a structured program designed to help patients recover from heart conditions or surgery. It includes supervised exercise, dietary counseling, stress management, and medication guidance. The goal is to strengthen the heart, improve fitness, and reduce the risk of future cardiac problems. This program is highly beneficial for those who have suffered a heart attack, undergone bypass surgery, or have chronic heart disease. It improves long-term heart health and quality of life."

            "description": "Heart failure management is a comprehensive treatment approach for patients with weakened heart function. It includes medications, lifestyle changes, and monitoring to prevent complications. Doctors prescribe drugs to improve heart efficiency and reduce fluid buildup. Patients follow a heart-healthy diet, engage in controlled exercise, and undergo regular check-ups. Advanced treatments include implantable devices or surgeries. Effective management helps reduce hospital visits, prolongs life, and enhances overall well-being for heart failure patients."
